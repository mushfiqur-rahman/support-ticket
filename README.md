#### Sentry Setup

Create a new Sentry Project and run the Wizard command it gives you. This will create a new .env-sentry-plugin file. Rename it to .env. This will have your Sentry Auth Token in it.

```

#### Auth Setup

Add an auth secret to your .env file. You can run the following command to generate one:

openssl rand -hex 32
```

Then add it to your .env file:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<your_secret>"
```

#### Prisma Setup

Run the following command to generate the Prisma client and create the database tables:

npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```
